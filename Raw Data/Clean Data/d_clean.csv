2. Identify or rezone sufficient, adequate sites within 180 days of project approval to accommodate any shortfall; and

Specifically, the City has provided CDBG funds for the following organizations: Shared Bread and St. Paul’s United Methodist Church. Additionally, beginning in 2016, the City initiated a contract with People Assisting The Homeless (PATH) to provide coordinated entry services to those individuals experiencing homelessness and or facing the possibility of homelessness. This program is included in the 2017 Housing Element Update and the City's recently adopted 6th Cycle Housing Element. 

Additionally, Redondo Beach is working with HUD-VASH (Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing) to find permanent housing for homeless veterans. Redondo Beach Housing Authority has a total of 23 veterans housed in Redondo Beach under the HUD-VASH program. The goal of the RBHA is to utilize all 40 VASH vouchers allocated to the City. The City also recently approved, 11/10/20, ""Pallet Shelter Transitional Housing"" at a location near the Galleria to support the local homeless population. Funding was provided from a combination of Federal, County, and local resources. 

In 2020 the City decided to continue and expanded the Response to Homelessness Program. One new branch of the Response to Homelessness Program is the Housing Initiative Court, known as Redondo Beach’s Homeless Court. This provides a local venue for addressing court cases related to those experiencing homelessness, to reduce the burden of transportation access to those defendants.

Another branch of the Response to Homelessness Program has been bridge housing. Bridge housing brings stabilization to people experiencing homelessness and helps them acclimate to a more structured lifestyle that will allow them to take the necessary steps towards permanent housing.

In addition to bridge housing, the City has officially supported the development of permanent supportive housing. The State of California established a program for funding for various housing projects through the Project Homekey program. Century Housing Corporation, a nonprofit housing development organization, is partnering with Los Angeles County as a co-applicant for funding to acquire and renovate a hotel site at 716 South Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach for permanent supportive housing. On November 9, 2021, the Redondo Beach City Council voted unanimously to support the Homekey Round 2 application from the joint applicants of Century Housing Corporation and Los Angeles County to provide housing for those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless. The application was submitted and supplemental information is being considered in early 2022. Once funding is obtained, the acquisition and remodeling can begin in 2022 to develop 20 units of affordable housing in the form of permanent supportive housing.

In April of 2021, the Redondo Beach Mayor and City Council voted to make the Response to Homelessness Program permanent, which includes key components such as the Housing Initiative Court and bridge housing like the Pallet Shelters. The approval also included funding for an additional housing navigator. The expectation is to keep the program under the administration of the City Attorney’s Office for at least three years,

This effectively made all units under the protections of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance subject to a just-cause only eviction process, effectively providing greater eviction protection for approximately 7,400 units.  The Rent Stabilization administers approximately 7,700 units. In addition, this amendment strengthened the mission of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance to promote the stability of renter populations and to maintain the quality of the Beverly Hills housing stock.

The City adopted a local Energy Reach Code that requires a higher standard for efficiency and solar for designs that include natural gas.  All-electric buildings may be built to the State’s baseline efficiency requirements. 

The Energy Reach Code that went into effect January 1, 2020, reduces operational carbon in new buildings by leveraging Santa Monica’s decarbonized electricity supply and encouraging the construction of all-electric buildings.  New buildings in Santa Monica have two design pathways for complying with the 2020 Energy Reach Code: All-electric (the preferred, simpler approach, may be built to the State’s baseline efficiency requirements) and mixed-fuel (when gas infrastructure is included the project must meet additional efficiency standards).  The Energy Reach Code also requires all new buildings and major additions to install an on-site solar photovoltaic system.  Also, new pools, if they are to be heated, must utilize solar thermal and/or electric heat-pump water heaters. 

Amend the 2019 California Green Building Standards Code to increase Electric Vehicle (EV) parking requirements.

More than 13,000 inquiries are handled annually. The Board monitors owner-occupancy evictions to ensure that this ground for eviction is not abused and an inter-departmental task-force addresses issues related to Ellis withdrawals and the current use of those properties.  The City actively enforces the Tenant Harassment Ordinance that the Council adopted in 2011.  Measure RR extended eviction protections to non-controlled units in 2010.

Because the City’s electricity now comes from non-polluting sources, the City is encouraging electrification of end-uses that have historically burned gas, such as water heating, space heating, cooking, and vehicles.  There are efficient electric alternatives such as heat-pump water heaters, heat-pump HVAC systems, and induction cooktops that are high performing and create healthier indoor air quality. The City launched an Electrify Santa Monica rebate program to help offset costs of converting gas equipment to efficient electric alternatives.  In addition, the City launched a third phase of EV Charger rebates for multi-unit buildings and small businesses.  

The Energy Reach Code that went into effect January 1, 2020, reduces operational carbon in new buildings by leveraging Santa Monica’s decarbonized electricity supply and encouraging the construction of all-electric buildings. The Energy Reach Code encourages  newly constructed buildings be designed all-electric, but still offers a compliance pathway for mixed-fuel designs.  The Energy Reach Code requires a higher standard for efficiency and solar for designs that include natural gas.  All-electric buildings may be built to the State’s baseline efficiency requirements. 

The Energy Reach Code also requires all new buildings and major additions to install an on-site solar photovoltaic system.  Also, new pools, if they are to be heated, must utilize solar thermal and/or electric heat-pump water heaters. 

The City also amended the 2019 California Green Building Standards Code to increase Electric Vehicle (EV) parking requirements.

In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at a density of 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,"The Local Coastal Program Amendment to allow for multi-family development in compliance with the adopted 2013-2021 Housing Element was certified by the California Coastal Commission on December 11, 2019.",Accomplished - The applicable LCP amendments have been certified.

Subsequently, the City was informed in 2017 of Avalon Bay’s intent to pay off their bond early, putting an additional 120 affordable units at risk of going to market rate.  While the City was unsuccessful at preserving the affordable units at both properties, the City followed the steps outlined in the program in order to attempt to preserve the units.  In both cases, staff conducted an economic analysis to determine the cost of buying down the rents, and determined that was not a viable option because the City’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund would be exhausted in less than two years.  The City contacted both property owners prior to the expiration of the bonds to discuss options for preserving the affordable units.  Malibu Canyon was not interested in preserving the units.  After meeting with staff to discuss options for preserving units, Avalon Bay submitted an initiative to construct 161 new market rate units and preserve 80 affordable units.

Program to develop objective design standards as part of an update to the City's Residential Design Guidelines.",Ongoing Programs,"Inclusionary Housing: During the discussion of the General Plan and Housing Element Annual Report in 2020, the Redondo Beach City Council expressed interest in preparation of an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. On October 20, 2020, the City Council awarded a contract for the preparation of an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. In November 2020, the City’s consultant provided an introductory presentation to City Council to go over the process of preparing an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, including selection of parameters and conducting a financial analysis of proposed parameters. On January 12, 2021, the City Council proposed parameters and the consultant presented the financial analysis to the City Council in late 2021 to refine the parameters. The ordinance is expected to be introduced and adopted in 2022.

Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs): The City is in the process of updating the existing Residential Design Guidelines to include Accessory Dwelling Units. The guidelines were adopted by the City of Redondo Beach on October 7, 2003. The design guidelines are intended to inform the public about development opportunities within the residential zones, including both single and multi-family structures. The update will also include the R-1A residential zone which was not included in the original document.

With the addition of ADUs and the R-1A Zone to the guidelines, the document will span the breadth of residential infill opportunities available within the City. With this update, owners in all residential zones will have a better understanding regarding the development potential of their properties. The guidelines will also include design templates for ADU configurations that are approvable by-right, subject to the existing conditions of the lot.

As a part of this exercise, new handout sheets will be created for easy application of the standards. By better informing the public, ADU applicants will have the tools to submit a successful application, thus reducing administrative review time. It is estimated that the ADUguidelines will reduce Planning review time in half from 8 weeks down to 4 weeks. Conversely, the City expects that permitting will double from 20-30 permits issued in 2019 and 2020 to an estimated 35-50 permits after the guidelines are updated.

Objective Design Standards: The City is in the process of updating the existing Residential Design Guidelines with objective design standards and to inform the public about development opportunities within the residential zones, including both single and multi-family structures."

DUARTE,2021,Affordable Housing Development Assistance,Provide regulatory incentives and available financial assistance.  Create and disseminate an Affordable Housing brochure.  Amend the Code to provide incentives for ELI units,Completed brochure and Code Amendment in 2014,"Progress: The City provided a land write-down, density bonus and
other regulatory incentives for the development of 42 very low
income senior units. The City sold three lots on Huntington Drive to
a developer for development of a major mixed-use project which
contains 161 apartment units; revenue from the property sale will
be deposited into the Housing Authority Fund and be used to
support affordable housing in the City. The City worked for several
months with a non-profit to develop 60-70 affordable units on a
Metro parking lot adjacent the Gold Line Station; Metro
subsequently changed its approach to development of the site and
will be issuing an RFP for development with affordable housing.
Effectiveness: With over 100 affordable housing units provided/in
process and funds generated in support of affordable development,
the City has been effective in the provision of a variety of affordable
housing throughout the community.

DUARTE,2021,Inclusionary Housing Ordinance,Implement inclusionary requirements to produce affordable units.  Establish implementing regulations for the Inclusionary Housing Trust Fund.,Established Housing Trust Fund regulations in 2015.,"Progress: In June 2016, City Council adopted a five-year
suspension of Duarte's Inclusionary Housing Program (including
the in-lieu fee) amid concerns that the program may be impeding
development. In conjunction with the 6th cycle Housing Element
update, the City contracted with an economic consulting firm to
review the financial feasibility of re-instating the City’s Inclusionary
Housing Program. A pro forma analysis of a model multi-family
rental project was prepared to determine if the project would remain
financially feasible if an inclusionary housing in-lieu fee was
included in the costs of development.
Effectiveness: The Inclusionary Program was suspended during
most of the planning period.
Appropriateness: The Inclusionary Housing Feasibility Study
found that rates of return on multi-family projects in Duarte were
already below that of the region, and that an additional Inclusionary
Housing In-Lieu Fee would serve as a disincentive to development
(refer to Section 3 Constraints for a more detailed discussion of
Study’s findings). This program is therefore no longer appropriate
for the Housing Element. Instead of charging an In-Lieu Fee, the
5-6 2021-2029 Housing Element
City can utilize new, alternatives sources of funding such as State
SB 2 grants for affordable housing and the San Gabriel Valley
Regional Housing Trust."

Approximately 98% of residents and businesses are supplied with electricity from renewable sources through the Clean Power Alliance, now in its third year of operation.  Because the City’s electricity now comes from non-polluting sources, the City is encouraging electrification of end-uses that have historically burned gas, such as water heating, space heating, cooking, and vehicles.  There are efficient electric alternatives such as heat-pump water heaters, heat-pump HVAC systems, and induction cooktops that are high performing and create healthier indoor air quality. The City launched an Electrify Santa Monica rebate program to help offset costs of converting gas equipment to efficient electric alternatives.  In addition, the City launched a third phase of EV Charger rebates for multi-unit buildings and small businesses.

MALIBU,2020,"B. Facilitate New Affordable Housing Development
In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at a density of 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,"The Local Coastal Program Amendment to allow for multi-family development in compliance with the adopted 2013-2021 Housing Element was certified by the California Coastal Commission on December 11, 2019.",Accomplished - The applicable LCP amendments have been certified.

MALIBU,2018,"B. Facilitate New Affordable Housing Development
In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,Throughout the planning period,Ongoing - The City is still working with the California Coastal Commission to approve the required code amendments.

In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,Throughout the planning period,Accomplished as the LCP amendments have now been certified.

northwestern portion of the City just south of Garvey Avenue and west of Rosemead Boulevard. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance was amended to permit such uses by right without discretionary review within this zone,
and to ensure emergency shelters are only subject to the same development and management standards that

to Prevent and Combat Homelessness, and recently was awarded a
grant to help assist residents with utility bills. The goal of this
program is to keep residents in their homes and prevent them from
becoming homeless.
Appropriateness: According to the 2020 Point in Time Count, the

CDBG program. However, due to a change in regulations by
LACDA and HUD to no longer allow grouping of contractor bids
across multiple projects, the single-family rehab program became
too staff intensive and unsustainable for a small city with staffing
constraints. The City instead directs its approximately $140,000 in
annual CDBG funds towards needed infrastructure improvements
in low and moderate income neighborhoods.
Effectiveness: While the City no longer uses its CDBG funding
allocation to implement a housing rehabilitation program, it
continues to provide information and referral to LA County's Home
Improvement Programs.
Appropriateness: Advertising rehabilitation assistance available
through the County does not require a distinct program in the
Housing Element. A new program with active City funding and
involvement to acquire and rehabilitate deteriorating multi-family
properties will be added to the Housing Element."

check the following month. The 344 unit Duarte Station mixed-use
project (Building A) received entitlements in November 2019, and
Plan Check was completed in December 2020. The project has
been issued grading permits and will be issued building permits in
Spring 2021.
Effectiveness: As a small City, staff have the advantage of
working closely with applicants through the review and approval
process, thereby helping to expedite the issuance of building and
zoning permits. In addition, the City has several processes in
place which help to minimize project review times, including
concurrent processing, pre-application reviews, and Program EIRs
for the Duarte Station Specific Plan and Town Center Specific Plan
which allow for individual projects which fall within the scope of the
EIR to utilize this as environmental clearance under CEQA.
Appropriateness: The time and uncertainty involved with
processing development projects can contribute significantly to
project costs, serving as a disincentive to development. Duarte’s
continued focus on efficient processing through its Community
Development Department remains integral to the way the City does
business."

The City also developed incentives to encourage maintenance and rehabilitation of historic rent-stabilized apartment buildings, and worked on a possible low interest loan fund to assist in rehabilitating aging rent stabilized apartment buildings.  In 2018, the City also estabilished a Tenant Habitability Plan requirement for seismic projects to minimize construction impact to in-place tenants during retrofitting.

The Boyle Heights Community Plan update completed a parking study in 2015, which will inform the plan update. The Re:Code LA effort is creating a wider menu of parking options that better fit the design intent of a project. A citywide update to the Transportation Demand Management (TDM) ordinance is underway and will allow for creative alternatives to traditional vehicle parking that will better serve the mobility needs of residents. State density bonus law was amended in 2020 to further reduce parking for affordable housing located near transit."

In CY 2020:
• HCIDLA continued to monitor the at-risk affordable housing portfolio and updated the Affordable Housing Database (AHD).
- Compiled AHD data to update of the annual Citywide At-risk Affordable Housing Inventory Report.
- Developed a risk matrix to identify projects that are at highest risk of conversion.
•Completed reports and recommendations that assisted the HCIDLA in identifying resources to preserve at-risk units and conduct property owner/tenant outreach and education.
- Presented a Preservation report back transmittal to the City Council in response to C.F. 19-0521 summarizing strategies to preserve, rehabilitate, and extend expiring housing covenants (pending Mayor's office approval).  
- Prepared a Citywide At-risk Affordable Housing Inventory Report, which analyzed 214 projects totaling 8,306 restricted units with covenants expiring in the years 2018 to 2024 to be included in the Preservation Report-back transmittal.
•Enforced State preservation notice requirements and compliance through monitoring and tracking ""notices of intent"" to exit the affordable housing market.  The noticing requirements are used by HCIDLA as an anti-displacement tool to enable and conduct tenant outreach and identify preservation opportunities.
• The Linkage Fee funding in CY 2020 was $3,947,211, which was allocated towards Rental - Preservation Expenditures and is currently available to be used towards at-risk preservation projects. This type of funding provides the most flexibility to incentivize owners to extend affordability although resources are limited.  
- Held meetings with owners/managers as well as potential investors to discuss at-risk projects and strategies to preserve utilizing Linkage Fee.
• Efforts to prevent and minimize tenant displacement when affordability covenants or rental assistance contracts are terminated was provided by the Coalition for Economic Survival (CES), an At-Risk Affordable Housing Tenant Outreach and Education Services (AAHTOES) consultant. These efforts allow HCIDLA to prevent potential tenant displacement, monitor properties, and coordinate efforts with owners and residents through the termination of affordability covenants.  
- Tenant outreach and education services were conducted at 18 at-risk properties consisting of 326 restricted units in CY 2020, which increased the awareness of the residents’ rights, responsibilities and options, affordability expiration or termination notices, and potential housing alternatives upon expiration or termination of affordability covenants and/or rental assistance contracts. 
- The current contract term is for one year from July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021.  This was the last amending term. An At-Risk Affordable Housing Tenant Outreach and Education Services (AAHTOES) RFP was prepared by HCIDLA to re-procure these services over the next three years."

The program launched in early 2017 and as of May 2019 the SRP has been revised to expand eligibility and the overall scope of the initial program.
If approved, customers can get a fixed roof lease payment from the LADWP. Depending on the installed system size, LADWP will either issue a fixed monthly lease payment between $20 and $50 per month, or between $240 and $600 per year. The agreement is valid for up to 20 years and can therefore provide cumulative financial benefits between $4,800 and $12,000 depending on system size.
Solar Rooftops installations provide energy directly to the grid to help LADWP meet the clean energy goals of Los Angeles and California. LADWP performs a home evaluation, issues permits, develops designs, and installs the SRP system at zero cost to customers. There are no upfront costs, annual fees, credit checks or maintenance costs for program participants. The SRP will enable customers to help the LADWP modernize its grid and support the creation of a cleaner Los Angeles.

Shared Solar enables residential customers living in multifamily dwellings (apartments, condominiums, duplexes) to fix a portion of their electric bill against rising utility costs for 10 years, as well as support renewable energy, help create local jobs, help reduce the carbon footprint of LADWP’s generation portfolio and lessen the impact of global warming. There are no enrollment fees, ongoing costs, maintenance costs, nor the hassles of installing a solar array on your home. Program participants subscribe for either the minimum of 50 kWh or the maximum of 100 kWh of energy on a monthly basis. The 50 or 100 KWh of electricity is supplied by new solar power plants constructed in or near the LA basin and is billed at a fixed Shared Solar Program (SSP) rate.

This requires the Department to monitor and maintain lessor information, validate and update ownership in BIMS. Note: Above-Ground leases are a relatively new business model, and this information is NOT accessible through the L.A. County Recorder's Office, since the land remains under the original ownership, e.g. MTA has an underground subway station and then leases the area above the ground to the lessee who then builds a residential rental property.
