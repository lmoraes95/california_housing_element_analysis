In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at a density of 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,"The Local Coastal Program Amendment to allow for multi-family development in compliance with the adopted 2013-2021 Housing Element was certified by the California Coastal Commission on December 11, 2019."

In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at a density of 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,"The Local Coastal Program Amendment to allow for multi-family development in compliance with the adopted 2013-2021 Housing Element was certified by the California Coastal Commission on December 11, 2019."

MALIBU,2018,"B. Facilitate New Affordable Housing Development
In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,Throughout the planning period
MALIBU,2018,"Program 3.2 – Provide Financial Support and Referral Information to Persons in Need of Assistance
Malibu is a small jurisdiction without a redevelopment agency or housing department and is not an entitlement jurisdiction for federal grants. Therefore, the City does not have any resources for direct financial housing assistance, other than a small Affordable Housing Trust Fund and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. The City will provide referral information to extremely-low-, very-low-, low-, and moderate-income persons and families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities regarding affordable and special needs housing, such as Section 8 Rental Assistance and the Mortgage Credit Certificate program.  In addition, it will continue to seek CDBG and HOME funds. 
a. Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Maintain an Affordable Housing Trust Fund and use the proceeds to leverage other sources of funding for affordable housing. 
b. State and Federal Grants. Where feasible, seek state and federal grant funds, such as CDBG and HOME, in order to provide support for affordable housing activities. 
c. Section 8 Rental Assistance. Provide referral information to low-income persons seeking rental assistance by publicizing the program in flyers posted at City Hall, the City’s website and other public locations.
d. Mortgage Credit Certificates. Provide referral information regarding the mortgage credit certificate program to homebuyers by publicizing the program in flyers posted at City Hall, the City website and other public locations.",Disseminate housing assistance information; provide direct funding in support of affordable housing when feasible,"The City’s Housing Coordinator has responsibility for monitoring all activities related to Housing Element implementation, including preparation of annual progress reports, annual monitoring of sources of financial assistance such as Section 8, state/federal grants, and mortgage credit certificates. The Housing Coordinator shall also be responsible for disseminating information to the community regarding this activities and resources. 
Depending on program availability and City eligibility, apply for state/federal funds on a bi-annual basis to assist affordable housing development."

In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the MMC and LCP regulations were amended in the previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alternative, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one basis. Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for compliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit's continued affordability. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the additional units allowed at 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.",Provide suitable sites with appropriate zoning that could accommodate lower- income housing,Throughout the planning period
